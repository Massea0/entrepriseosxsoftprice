# Enterprise OS Genesis Framework - Arcadis Technologies

## Overview

This is a comprehensive enterprise management platform built by Arcadis Technologies for the Senegalese market. The system features a modern full-stack architecture with React frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and advanced AI capabilities powered by Google Gemini and ElevenLabs APIs. The platform includes modules for HR management, project management, business operations, and AI-powered insights.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for fast development and building
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Tanstack React Query for server state, React Context for global state
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access control
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections for voice assistant and live updates

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Functions for AI processing and serverless operations
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for voice interactions

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Supabase-based authentication with email/password
- Role-based access control (super_admin, admin, manager, employee, client, user, viewer)
- Protected routes with middleware
- User context management

### AI Integration Layer
- **Gemini Live API**: Real-time voice interaction and text generation
- **ElevenLabs**: High-quality text-to-speech with French voice support
- **AI Modules**: Business analyzer, predictive analytics, workflow orchestrator
- **Voice Assistant**: Advanced WebSocket-based voice interface with audio processing

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management
- **AI Agents**: Autonomous agent configuration and management

- **HR Management**: Employee data, departments, organization structure
- **Business Operations**: Quotes, invoices, clients, contracts

### UI Components
- Comprehensive design system with shadcn/ui
- Responsive layouts with mobile-first approach
- Advanced components: Kanban boards, org charts, voice interfaces
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls through React Query
2. **Authentication**: Supabase handles auth flow and JWT tokens
3. **API Layer**: Express server processes requests with middleware
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles type-safe database interactions
5. **AI Processing**: Edge functions process AI requests and return insights
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live features
7. **Client Updates**: React Query automatically updates UI with fresh data

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting with connection pooling
- **Supabase**: Authentication, real-time subscriptions, and edge functions
- **Google Gemini**: AI model for text generation and analysis
- **ElevenLabs**: Voice synthesis and audio processing

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for server code

### Third-party Integrations
- Advanced drag-and-drop with @dnd-kit
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- Audio processing worklets for voice features
- PDF generation capabilities

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR
- tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- Automatic database migrations with Drizzle
- Environment variable configuration for API keys

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized frontend bundle
- ESBuild bundles server code for Node.js
- Static assets served from Express server
- Database migrations applied automatically

### Environment Configuration
The system requires several environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google AI API key for Gemini models
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: ElevenLabs API for voice synthesis
- `SUPABASE_URL` and keys for authentication services

The architecture emphasizes type safety, real-time capabilities, and scalable AI integration while maintaining a clean separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and AI processing layers.
